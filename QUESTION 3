WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY POINTERS? WRITE A CODE HOW YOU CAN INITIALISE THE POINTER.
ANS:-A Pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.
.The address-of operator (&) is used to get the memory address of a variable.
.The dereference operator (*) is used to access the value stored at the memory address held by the pointer.

Code Example: Declaring and Initializing a Pointer

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // 1. Declare a normal integer variable
    int num = 42;

    // 2. Declare a pointer variable (must be of the same type as the variable it points to)
    // The '*' indicates that 'ptr_num' is a pointer to an integer.
    int *ptr_num;

    // 3. Initialize the pointer:
    // Store the memory address of 'num' into 'ptr_num' using the address-of operator (&).
    ptr_num = &num;

    // Output:
    printf("Value of num: %d\n", num);                  // 42
    printf("Address of num (and value of ptr_num): %p\n", &num);
    printf("Value at the address pointed to by ptr_num (*ptr_num): %d\n", *ptr_num); // 42

    return 0;
}
